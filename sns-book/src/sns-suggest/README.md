# SNS Suggest Introduction - Alpha

The SNS Suggest API can be used by applications looking to offer autocomplete or autosuggest for `.sol` domains. To get an API key please contact us on Twitter or Discord.

⚠️ This API is not meant to replace the blockchain as the source of truth. The blockchain should always be considered as the only source of truth. This API is only a snapshot of the blockchain at a certain point in time and might be stale by a few seconds/minutes.

⚠️ This feature is currently experimental and is subject to change
